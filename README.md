## Constraints to Our Project
- As We Don't have Separate Admin and User Interface, we have only 1 System. So We have to Implement a single Registration / SignIn Interface 
- But we have a Role Based System , so We develop the Interface such that new user are always by default students and they can upgrade to higher roles by admin or Referral Program 
- As a Single Interface We have to implement Midleware to Restrict Access to Confidential Routes

## Initial ReadMe Commit By Nextjs 13
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel
